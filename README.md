# First Semester Algorithms üñ•Ô∏è

This project is part of the first exercise from the "Algorithms and Programming: Introduction" course in my Computer Science degree at Unisinos.

## About the Project
This exercise, completed about four semesters ago, required creating a simple Python menu that executed actions based on user input. As an introductory course, we started with Python due to its accessibility and to help us build a foundation in programming logic. 

In the following modules, we transitioned to Java, which introduced significant changes to how we structured our code. This repository contains one of my early experiences with programming and showcases my initial learning process.

## Features
- A Python-based menu system
- Simple user interactions through the command line
- Basic operations executed according to user input

## Technologies Used
- Python
